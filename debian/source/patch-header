Subject: Collected Debian patches for shibboleth-sp2
Author: Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>

The packaging for shibboleth-sp2 is maintained in Git using multiple
branches for fixes, which makes it complex to separate the changes
into individual patches.  They are therefore all included in a single
Debian patch.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git
repository.
